Install pytopo on your local machine with
python setup.py install

Or get it from PyPI:
pip install pytopo

Either way, the executables will be called pytopo and ellie.
On its first run it will create the configuration file it needs.

Developers: you can run pytopo from the development directory by running
pytopo/MapViewer.py, as long as your PYTHONPATH points to somewhere
where Python can import the pytopo module.

Run ellie from pytopo/trackstats.py -- though right now ellie is
untested because there's a fatal matplotlib bug getting in the way.

Build the API documentation with:
  cd docs/sphinxdoc/
  make html
Requires python-sphinx (or python3-sphinx).
